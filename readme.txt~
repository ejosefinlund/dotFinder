This program is written by Josefin Lund 2014.

Its purpose is to find the number of cells in an image.
Definition of cell: roundish area in a color different from the ambient.

Parts:

Main: loads image, calls method to convert image to black and white.

In the future: enhance contrast of image to simplify finding of cells.

dotFunctions 
Global variables:
numberOfDots = 0
cellPixels = []

methods:
- make image black and white
	in: rgb or black and white image
	out: black and white image

- a set that keeps track of pixels that contain the cell color and have already been found and counted by the program.

- a function that searches through the pixels in order. Right to left, downwards. If a pixel is found that is not yet contained by cellPixels, the (x,y) of the pixel is sent to the cellInvestigator method.

- cellInvestigator method. Gets the coordinate upper left coordinate of a new cell that needs to be investigated.
Searches through every row of the cell to find he borders of it and ad it to cellPixels. After the cell is investigated, numberOfDots =+1.


Possible future improvements:
Reduce the resoultion of the image if the cells tend to be big enough to be found anyway.
